# Stealth Roll-a-Ball (Unity)

This is a Unity 3D stealth-style mini-game inspired by the classic Roll-a-Ball tutorial, but extended with custom features:

## Features
- 🛡️ Enemy AI patrols using NavMeshAgent
- 👀 Guard vision detection system
- 🧱 Custom-built environment and obstacles
- 🎵 Sound effects for actions (collect, caught, restart)
- 🔁 Restart button to reset the scene
- 🗺️ Basic minimap system (work in progress)

## Technologies Used
- Unity 2022.3 LTS
- C#
- Visual Studio 2022
- GitHub for version control

## Notes
This project helped me reconnect with Unity, refresh my C# scripting, and practice implementing simple AI, UI, and physics mechanics from scratch.
